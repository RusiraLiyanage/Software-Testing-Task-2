#### 2.	TestNG
#### 3.	Rest Assured
#### 4.	Allure Reporting

#### Evosuite was used to generate test cases automatically for JUnit test methods and it is avaliabe as a seperate project for the reference of how test cases can be generated.

#### The main reason to have seperate files for Junit test methods and test cases is to follow coding practices of java object oriented programming.
